# Hunter Herbst Fall 2023 Note Repo #

This is simply just a massive repo of all my notes for the Fall 2023 semester. I am taking two classes:

* COP4020 Functional Programming
* CAP4720 Computer Graphics

Notes are compiled down into PDF from Markdown, but both are in the repo, and I also have example scripts saved into my notes as well.

I hope this pushes to the right branch, I hate that they changed Master into Main, I always forget. >:(
